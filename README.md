## 1. Install node modules for the project

Go to client and server directories and run `npm install` in from the command line in both directories.

Go to server/src/ directory and start the development server by running `node index.js` from the commandline.

## 3. Start the client app

# Server & Client Branches

These two branches are created for deploying the app in Heroku platform. They contain modifications that allow the app to be live in Heroku server.
You can open the live app through the following link but be aware that launchig the app may take some time because of the free version of the service I currently have.
